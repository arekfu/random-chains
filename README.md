random-chains
=============

This is a toy model for studying what happens when you want to sample a large
number of things and sampling each thing usually does not cost a lot but
sometimes it does, and you don't want to pay a lot, so you want to stop as soon
as the total cost that you have paid exceeds some fixed computational budget.
Does that bias your outcome?
